Catalist is an Android application built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, used to explore cat breeds.
It provides a list of breeds, detailed information (images, traits, lifespan, origin, behavior), and a search feature.
The app follows the MVI architecture and uses Retrofit/OkHttp and Hilt for dependency injection.
